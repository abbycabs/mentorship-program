#Mentor Tip Sheet

Thank you so much for being a mentor in this program! You'll play a vital role supporting new leaders and facilitating connections within the network.

Mentors will:
* Continue to model working openly in your communities and projects
* Meet with Abby (30min) once a month for support, encouragement and coaching training
  * Mondays at 1:00-1:30pm ET, every four weeks starting August 15
* Meet with your assigned project leads (30min) every two weeks (you will be assigned 1-2 project leads)
* Be available as necessary to connect with your assigned project leads to tackle specific issues
* Attend at least three of the weekly ‘Office Hours’ (1h) over the 12 week program together with the cohort going through the Open Leadership Training Series
  * Mondays at 12:00-1:00pm ET, every week starting August 22
* If possible, attend MozFest (Oct 28-30, London UK) and run a session


## 1:1 meetings

There are three main goals of these mentorship meetings. You'll see these reflected in the structure and resources we provide.

1. **Connect as humans**: Use this one on one time to get to know the people you are mentoring and help connect them to others in the network. For many of them, this will be their first time at MozFest -- these meetings give them a chance to make a buddy before the big event.
  * Spend some time in each meeting getting to know them personally. Be genuine when asking how they're doing.
  * Introduce them to others who may have relevant interests or skills to their project.
2. **Help their project suceed**: We're helping participants engage and deepen contributorship on their projects and sessions.
  * Set goals around their project and help break them down to tasks to work on over the next 12 weeks.
  * Connect them to resources or skills they may need, if possible.
  * Help them craft / prepare their MozFest session so they can leverage the event to help their project.
3. **Apply lessons from Working Open**: Help participants apply what they're learning in the *Open Leadership Training Series* to their specific projects.
  * If you have time, review their assignments and provide feedback when appropriate.
  * Encourage them to apply best practices from working open to their work.

I believe it's important to onboard mentees as well as mentors.

Three levels of listening:
